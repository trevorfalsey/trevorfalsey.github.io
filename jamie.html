<h2>The Art of Jamie Zeccola: Finding Humor in a Pessimistic World</h2>


<p>Rushing down 14th street, a vibrant light blue poster caught my eye. Written with a black marker reads a list of new years resolutions urging others to slow down and enjoy the present: a message often rehearsed but rarely performed.</p>

<p class="txt1"><b>Dance More   Love More   Paint More</b></p>

<p>At the bottom of the poster, the name Duke A. Barnstable is written scrawly. Barnstable’s street art can be found scattered throughout the city, most often in Chelsea and on the Lower East Side. Each work builds a whimsical atmosphere, immersing the viewer into a jovial world, even if its for a brief minute. Who is the person behind the street art?</p>

<p>Born in Princeton, New Jersey, in 1966, <a href="http://www.jamiezeccola.com/"target=_blank>Jamie Zeccola</a> (also known as <a href="http://dukeabarnstable.blogspot.com/"target=_blank>Duke A Barnstable</a>, a pseudonym used for his street art) first moved to New York City in the late 1980s. Since then, he has worked extensively on a variety of creative projects. His paintings inhabited multiple galleries, including the <a href="https://spacewomb.wordpress.com/"target=_blank>SPACEWOMb gallery</a>, <a href="http://www.roguespacechelsea.com/"target=_blank>Rogue Space</a>, and the Peter Louis Salon gallery. He first started doing street art as a way to draw attention to his gallery art. </p>

<p>It’s a quiet Sunday afternoon at the beginning of March and a fresh coat of snow blankets the streets. Zeccola is at his studio in Long Island City, Queens. The wall is covered with radiant and polychromatic paintings, brazenly embracing flamboyance. Others rest on the floor, leaning against the wall. Stacks of books, higher than the average person and visibly heavily read, form into an artificial mountain range next to the window.</p>

<p>Zeccola paces around the room with the energy that his paintings reflect, enthusiastically discussing his work and his process. He is tall and thin with a 5 o’clock shadow, wearing a button-up shirt and faded blue jeans.</p>

<p>Describing his work as inspired by <a href="https://www.theartstory.org/movement-abstract-expressionism.htm"target=_blank>abstract expressionism</a>, he admits that his style is more of a goulash. Many of his paintings embrace the taboo, depicting sex scenes and nudity. Through the use of vibrant colors and distorted shapes, Zeccola uses his paintings as a way to invite the observer into what seems like a psychedelic, light-hearted trip of humor, hyper-realism, and performativity.</p>

<p>In the left corner, placed above a window, one of the artworks catches my eye, a portrait of the idolized author, Shakespeare. In front of a delft blue background, showing only the shoulders up, Shakespeare wears a dark green strapless dress. His skin is painted in a bright white, with the exception of his cheeks which are painted in dark pink to imitate blushing, and proudly wears dark blue mascara. A brown cork protrudes from the neck, breaking the usual two-dimensional boundaries of a standard painting.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">“Paintings are just a performance,” he said casually, referencing his Shakespeare in drag. “As a painter, you’re always putting on a performance.”</blockquote>


<p>Many of his paintings are layered in paint, creating texture and enhancing the three-dimensional effect. Zeccola experimented with more than just creating a texture out of layers of paint, but also includes actual objects in his work. In one painting, a woman holds a black leather strap, standing fully nude as another person lays in bed, seemingly mesmerized. Zeccola actively erodes the barrier between the audience and the art, inviting viewers to not only see his work but also to feel it. When discussing the gallery rules that usually prevent the audience from touching the art, he noticeably became discontent.</p>

<p>“My paintings are meant to be touched. I want people to touch my paintings. I want signs around my painting that say, ‘Please Touch Me.’” </p>

<p>When asked about the intentions behind his street, he nonchalantly replied that he “just thought, what do I want to do more of. You spend so much time doing things you hate.” He thinks of the constraints the hold back us and how we are in this trapped in a perpetual cycle of aimlessly moving along unsure of our purpose or passions. This message is strongly expressed in his recent series of street art, COLD WAR IN NYC.</p>

<p>When thinking about what to include in the list of “NYC Street Resolutions,” part of the <a href="http://dukeabarnstable.blogspot.com/2019/01/cold-war-in-nyc.html"target="_blank">COLD WARD IN NYC</a> series, Zeccola reflected on his time as a commercial artist for over 10 years, creating art primarily used for advertising.  </p>

<p>“I use to work in commercial art. It’s such a hard thing finding the work, doing the work, and it’s this nonstop. You spend so much time doing busy work. So it's based on what I want to do that’s real. I want to paint more. I want to read more. Think about it. To me, that’s what luxury is — having time to be lazy. You don’t have time to think anymore! It’s just nonstop stimulation.</p>

<p>Zeccola believes humor is the most crucial aspect of his art, assuming that is what makes his approach to art different from others.“I think that is lacking in Chelsea,” Zeccola says. </p>

<blockquote>“Life is tough. If you don’t laugh, you’re going to cry every day. Every day I want to slit my wrists and jump off the Brooklyn Bridge just living here.”</blockquote>


<p>The starving artist: it’s a well-rehearsed label that encapsulates the fight an artist undertakes working for discovery. What is evident from Zeccola’s work is not just a desire for success, but a longing for a connection. With street art, he finds this connection. Within the public sphere, his art speaks volumes and reveals a refreshing reminder to enjoy life and to find humor in it. </p>

<p>“It’s fascinating how someone can see something on the street and have it affect them, and you just carry it around with you. That’s the beauty of street art.”</p>
